    """Structural similarity index

    As described in [1]_, the structural similarity index (SSIM) is a
    perceptual distance metric, giving the distance between two images. SSIM is
    based on three comparison measurements between the two images: luminance,
    contrast, and structure. All of these are computed in windows across the
    images. See the references for more information.

    This implementations follows the original implementation, as found at [2]_,
    as well as providing the option to use the weighted version used in [4]_
    (which was shown to consistently improve the image quality prediction on
    the LIVE database).

    Argument
    --------
    img1 : torch.tensor
        4d tensor with first image to compare
    img2 : torch.tensor
        4d tensor with second image to compare. Must have the same height and
        width (last two dimensions) as `img1`
    window_size : int, optional
        size of the Gaussian window used to compute the statistics. If `window`
        is set, this argument is ignored.
    window : torch.tensor or None, optional
        4d tensor with the local window for computing statistics. If `None`,
        then we create a 2d Gaussian of size `window_size` (and use across all
        batches and channels). Should have a sum of 1 across the last two
        dimensions.
    size_average : bool, optional
        ???
    weighted : bool, optional
        whether to use the original, unweighted SSIM version (`False`) as used
        in [1]_ or the weighted version (`True`) as used in [4]_. See Notes
        section for the weight
    dynamic_range : int or None, optional.
        dynamic range of the images. Note we assume that both images have the
        same dynamic range. If None, we try to infer it from the image: if
        `img1` contains a value greater than 1, we assume its `max_val` is 255,
        else assume its 1; if it contains a value less than 0, we assume its
        `min_val` is -1, else assume its 0. We then set `dynamic_range` to
        `max_val-min_val`. For stability, you probably want to set this
        explicitly.

    Returns
    ------
    mssim : torch.tensor
        the mean SSIM, averaged over the whole image
    cs : torch.tensor
        ???
    ssim_map : torch.tensor
        the SSIM map, giving the SSIM value at each location on the image

    As described in  [1]_, this is an image quality metric based on the transformations associated with the early

    A laplacian pyramid subtracts a local estimate of the mean luminance at six scales.
    Then a local gain control divides these centered coefficients by a weighted sum of absolute values
    in spatial neighborhood.

    These weights parameters were optimized for redundancy reduction over an training
    database of (undistorted) natural images.

    Note that we compute root mean squared error for each scale, and then average over these,
    effectively giving larger weight to the lower frequency coefficients
    (which are fewer in number, due to subsampling).
