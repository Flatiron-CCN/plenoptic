def ssim(img1, img2, weighted=False, dynamic_range=1):
    """Structural similarity index

    As described in [1]_, the structural similarity index (SSIM) is a
    perceptual distance metric, giving the distance between two images. SSIM is
    based on three comparison measurements between the two images: luminance,
    contrast, and structure. All of these are computed in windows across the
    images. See the references for more information.

    This implementations follows the original implementation, as found at [2]_,
    as well as providing the option to use the weighted version used in [4]_
    (which was shown to consistently improve the image quality prediction on
    the LIVE database).

    Argument
    --------
    img1 : torch.tensor
        4d tensor with first image to compare
    img2 : torch.tensor
        4d tensor with second image to compare. Must have the same height and
        width (last two dimensions) as `img1`
    weighted : bool, optional
        whether to use the original, unweighted SSIM version (`False`) as used
        in [1]_ or the weighted version (`True`) as used in [4]_. See Notes
        section for the weight
    dynamic_range : int, optional.
        dynamic range of the images. Note we assume that both images have the
        same dynamic range. 1, the default, is appropriate for float images
        between 0 and 1, as is common in synthesis. 2 is appropriate for float
        images between -1 and 1, and 255 is appropriate for standard 8-bit
        integer images. We'll raise a warning if it looks like your value is
        not appropriate for `img1` or `img2`, but will calculate it anyway.

    Returns
    ------
    mssim : torch.tensor
        2d tensor containing the mean SSIM for each image, averaged over the
        whole image
    ssim_map : torch.tensor
        4d tensor containing the SSIM map, giving the SSIM value at each
        location on the image

    As described in  [1]_, this is an image quality metric based on the transformations associated with the early

    A laplacian pyramid subtracts a local estimate of the mean luminance at six scales.
    Then a local gain control divides these centered coefficients by a weighted sum of absolute values
    in spatial neighborhood.

    These weights parameters were optimized for redundancy reduction over an training
    database of (undistorted) natural images.

    Note that we compute root mean squared error for each scale, and then average over these,
    effectively giving larger weight to the lower frequency coefficients
    (which are fewer in number, due to subsampling).
