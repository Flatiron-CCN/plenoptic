    As described in [1]_, the structural similarity index (SSIM) is a
    perceptual distance metric, giving the distance between two images. SSIM is
    based on three comparison measurements between the two images: luminance,
    contrast, and structure. All of these are computed convolutionally across the
    images. See the references for more information.

    This implementation follows the original implementation, as found at [2]_,
    as well as providing the option to use the weighted version used in [4]_
    (which was shown to consistently improve the image quality prediction on
    the LIVE database).

    Note that this is a similarity metric (not a distance), and so 1 means the
    two images are identical and 0 means they're very different. It is bounded
    between 0 and 1.

    This function returns the mean SSIM, a scalar-valued metric giving the
    average over the whole image. For the SSIM map (showing the computed value
    across the image), call `ssim_map`.

    ----------
    img1 : torch.Tensor

    img2 : torch.Tensor

    weighted : bool, optional
        whether to use the original, unweighted SSIM version (`False`) as used
        in [1]_ or the weighted version (`True`) as used in [4]_. See Notes
        section for the weight
    dynamic_range : int, optional.
        dynamic range of the images. Note we assume that both images have the
        same dynamic range. 1, the default, is appropriate for float images
        between 0 and 1, as is common in synthesis. 2 is appropriate for float

        integer images. We'll raise a warning if it looks like your value is
        not appropriate for `img1` or `img2`, but will calculate it anyway.

    Returns
    ------
    mssim : torch.Tensor
        2d tensor of shape (batch, channel) containing the mean SSIM for each
        image, averaged over the whole image

    Notes
    -----
    The weight used when `weighted=True` is:

    .. math::
       \log((1+\frac{\sigma_1^2}{C_2})(1+\frac{\sigma_2^2}{C_2}))

    where :math:`sigma_1^2` and :math:`sigma_2^2` are the variances of `img1`
    and `img2`, respectively, and :math:`C_2` is a constant which depends on
    `dynamic_range`. See [4]_ for more details.

    r"""Multiscale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM)

    As described in [1]_, multiscale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) is
    an improvement upon structural similarity index (SSIM) that takes into
    account the perceptual distance between two images on different scales.

    SSIM is based on three comparison measurements between the two images:
    luminance, contrast, and structure. All of these are computed convolutionally
    across the images, producing three maps instead of scalars. The SSIM map is
    the elementwise product of these three maps. See `metric.ssim` and
    `metric.ssim_map` for a full description of SSIM.

    To get images of different scales, average pooling operations with kernel
    size 2 are performed recursively on the input images. The product of
    contrast map and structure map (the "contrast-structure map") is computed
    for all but the coarsest scales, and the overall SSIM map is only computed
    for the coarsest scale. Their mean values are raised to exponents and
    multiplied to produce MS-SSIM:
    .. math::
        MSSSIM = {SSIM}_M^{a_M} \prod_{i=1}^{M-1} ({CS}_i)^{a_i}
    Here :math: `M` is the number of scales, :math: `{CS}_i` is the mean value
    of the contrast-structure map for the i'th finest scale, and :math: `{SSIM}_M`
    is the mean value of the SSIM map for the coarsest scale. If at least one
    of these terms are negative, the value of MS-SSIM is zero. The values of
    :math: `a_i, i=1,...,M` are taken from the argument `power_factors`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img1 : torch.Tensor
        4d tensor with first image to compare
    img2 : torch.Tensor
        4d tensor with second image to compare. Must have the same height and
        width (last two dimensions) as `img1`
    dynamic_range : int, optional.
        dynamic range of the images. Note we assume that both images have the
        same dynamic range. 1, the default, is appropriate for float images
        between 0 and 1, as is common in synthesis. 2 is appropriate for float
        images between -1 and 1, and 255 is appropriate for standard 8-bit
        integer images. We'll raise a warning if it looks like your value is
        not appropriate for `img1` or `img2`, but will calculate it anyway.
    power_factors : 1D array, optional.
        power exponents for the mean values of maps, for different scales (from
        fine to coarse). The length of this array determines the number of scales.
        By default, this is set to [0.0448, 0.2856, 0.3001, 0.2363, 0.1333],
        which is what psychophysical experiments in [1]_ found.
