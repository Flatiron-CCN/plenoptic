    "# Implementing New Synthesis Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you are familiar with synthesis methods and have interacted with them in this package, and would like to either understand what happens under the hood a little better or implement your own using the existing API.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Synthesis` is an abstract class that should be inherited by any synthesis method (e.g., `Metamer`, `MADCompetition`). It provides many helper functions which, depending on your method, can be used directly or modified slightly. For the two extremes on this, see the source code for `Metamer` and `MADCompetition`: `Metamer` uses almost everything exactly as written, whereas because `MADCompetition` works with two models, requires extensive modification. Even when you're modifying the methods, however, you should try to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maintain the names and, as much as possible, the call signatures. We want it to be easy to use the different synthesis methods so the way users interact with them should be as similar as possible.\n",
    "  - The most common reason you'd modify the call signature would be for adding arguments. If an argument is a modification / tweak of an existing one, place it next to that existing argument. If it's completely novel (and important), place it near the beginning. \n",
    "  - For example, `MADCompetition` requires two models, instead of one, during intialization, and a new required argument, `synthesis_target` for `synthesize()`. The standard initialization call signature is `(target_image, model, loss_function, **model_kwargs)`, so `MADCompetition`'s is `(target_image, model_1, model_2, loss_function, model_1_kwargs, model_2_kwargs)`. The new argument for `synthesize()` goes at the beginning.\n",
    "2. Reuse existing methods. The basic idea of many synthesis methods is pretty similar: update the input image based on the gradient (or a function of the gradient) of the model. Therefore, the code for much of what you'll want to do already exists and you will just need to e.g., call it with a different argument, specify what model to use, modify the gradient before updating the image.\n",
    "3. Make sure all the existing public-facing methods either work or raise a `NotImplementedError`. We want people either to be able to use the methods they're used to from other synthesis methods for better understanding synthesis (for example, plotting the synthesis status or creating an animation of progress), or to know why they cannot. For example, because `MADCompetition` has two models, we want to plot both losses in `plot_loss`. We can make use of the existing `Synthesis.plot_loss()` method, just modifying where it grabs the data from, and call it twice. To the user, there's no difference in how it creates the plot. However, there's no need to do this for the private methods (e.g., `_set_seed()`).\n",
    "4. Add any natural generalizations. `MADCompetition` stimuli come in sets of 4, and so it makes sense to provide a function that generalizes `plot_synthesized_image()` to show all 4 of them: `plot_synthesized_image_all()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's walk through the structure of a `Synthesis` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most important functions are `__init__()`, which initializes the class, and `synthesize()` which synthesizes an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Synthesis.__init__()` provides a lot of code that you can use (as well as a basis for the docstring), and should be called unless you have a *really* good reason not to. It will automatically support the use of models and metrics, modifying the loss function, and initialize a lot of the class's attributes. You may want to call it and then do additional stuff, e.g., set up a second model or initialize new attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Synthesis.synthesize()` cannot be called, but provides a skeleton of what `synthesize()` should look like (as well as a basis for the docstring). It shows how the various hidden helper methods are used to set up the synthesis call and core loop. You'll probably want to copy this into your new synthesis method's `synthesize()` and then modify it. You'll certainly need to change the initialization of the matched image, which varies from method to method (for instance, `Metamer` uses random noise or a new image, whereas `MADCompetition` uses the reference image plus some noise). You may otherwise be able to ues the method as it's written, just modifying the helper functions."
